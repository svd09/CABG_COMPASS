# CABG_COMPASS
This is a public repo that provides code for the paper on CABG_COMPASS. The code is part of the analysis 
of the paper that studies the external applicability of the COMPASS trial among Veterans that 
underwent CABG in VA Medical Centers (2010 - 2018). 
Analysis was initially done with SQL to extract data from VINCI servers; remaining analysis 
was performed with R.
